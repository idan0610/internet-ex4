1. The hardest issue in the exercise was to take ex3 code and use for the current 
exercise. We had to change relatively a lot of code in order to make a 
proper exercise. Moreover, it is a very busy period, 
and we had to make a lot of sacrifices in order to finish the exercise.  

2. we enjoyed creating a server and actually see how it can be used for
 dynamic and static proposes.
